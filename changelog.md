<h3>Recipe Overload Update: Patch 2</h3>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This update introduces required compatibility with Farmer's Delight Refabricated, adjusts bread slicing, and refines sandwich recipes.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>‚ú® What's New:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recipes can now be made with ingredients from other mods. This feature will not work with Farmer's Delight [Fabric], read more details below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üß© Compatibility:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> More Delight now depends on the modern and updated <b><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-refabricated">Farmer's Delight Refabricated</a></b> port. Please update from the older Farmer's Delight port to continue enjoying More Delight's features.</li>
  <li><b>Why:</b> Farmer's Delight [Fabric] has been archived, and it will not receive updates anymore. If you are still playing with this older port, please use older versions of More Delight in order to play.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üçû Bread Balancing:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> Increased amount of bread slices when cutting bread from 2 slices to 4 slices, and removed the chance to get more bread slices when cutting bread.</li>
  <li><b>Why:</b> This change was made to make crafting sandwiches more affordable for players. By getting more slices from each loaf, players won't need to use as many resources to make their favorite sandwiches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ü•™ Sandwiches:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> Sandwiches, like the Bacon Sandwich, Steak with Egg Sandwich, and Tomato Sandwich, can now be made with either a whole bread or two bread slices. Sandwiches that require more bread, like the Egg Sandwich, can only be made with a whole bread.</li>
  <li><b>Why:</b> This change provides more flexibility when crafting simpler sandwiches while maintaining the recipe requirements for more complex ones.</li>
</ul>
